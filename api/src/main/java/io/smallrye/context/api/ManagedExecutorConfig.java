/**
 * <p>
 * Annotates a CDI injection point for a {@link ManagedExecutor} such that the container
 * creates a new instance, which is identified within an application by its unique name.
 * The unique name is generated as the fully qualified class name (with each component delimited by <code>.</code>)
 * and the injection point's field name or method name and parameter position, all delimited by <code>/</code>,
 * unless annotated with the {@link NamedInstance} qualifier,
 * in which case the unique name is specified by the {@link NamedInstance#value} attribute of that qualifier.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, the following injection points share a single
 * {@link ManagedExecutor} instance,
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code> {@literal @}Inject {@literal @}NamedInstance("exec1") {@literal @}ManagedExecutorConfig(maxAsync=5)
 * ManagedExecutor executor;
 *
 * {@literal @}Inject
 * void setCompletableFuture({@literal @}NamedInstance("exec1") ManagedExecutor exec) {
 *     completableFuture = exec.newIncompleteFuture();
 * }
 *
 * {@literal @}Inject
 * void setCompletionStage({@literal @}NamedInstance("exec1") ManagedExecutor exec) {
 *     completionStage = exec.supplyAsync(supplier);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, the following injection points each represent a distinct
 * {@link ManagedExecutor} instance,
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code> {@literal @}Inject {@literal @}ManagedExecutorConfig(propagated=ThreadContext.CDI)
 * ManagedExecutor exec2;
 *
 * {@literal @}Inject {@literal @}ManagedExecutorConfig(maxAsync=5)
 * ManagedExecutor exec3;
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the application stops, the container automatically shuts down instances
 * of {@link ManagedExecutor} that it created. The application can manually use the
 * {@link ManagedExecutor#shutdown} or {@link ManagedExecutor#shutdownNow} methods
 * to shut down a managed executor at an earlier point.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>ManagedExecutor</code> will fail to inject, raising
 * {@link jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.DefinitionException DefinitionException} on application startup,
 * if multiple injection points are annotated to create instances with the same name.
 * </p>
